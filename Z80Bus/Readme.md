# Z80Bus Expansion Options for the TEC-1G

## Z80Bus X4 Board

With the release of the Z80Bus Standard, including the KiCAD footprints and Gerbers so people can print their own Z80Bus system board, modules for the TEC-1 can very quickly and easily be developed that allow the USER to choose how they wish to connect the modules to their machines.

Boards designed with the innovative <b>IDC<sup>2</sup></b> connector footprint allow the user to choose to go hippie and continue to use ugly IDC cables with a Vertical IDC Box Header, or with a Right Angled Box Header, they have the ultimate in freedom to connect using IDC cables, <b>Quick-Connect<sup>®</sup></b> direct to the TEC-1, or using the <b>X4 System</b> and have multiple expansions boards all working in unison.
